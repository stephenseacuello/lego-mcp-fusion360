# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the LEGO MCP v8.0 project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.
